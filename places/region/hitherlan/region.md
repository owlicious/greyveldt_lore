<b>The Twilight Expansion & the Age of Golden Edvard</b>
Once, long, long ago, Hitherlan territory spanned much of the continent. This time, called the Twilight Expansion, began when the mighty God-Empress Astrid ascended to the Calcil Throne and darkness ran rampant over the land. The trifling quasimortal nobility of the earth's 3 corners possessed no great heroes, so the world was but a banquet for her terrible armies and ravenous population.

Accounts differ in terms of where and why it all went wrong.

...Yet all accounts converge in agreement that it began with the Age of Golden Edvard.

<b>Hitherlan Topography & Cultural Geography</b>
Hitherlan is a northerly peninsular nation, isolated from its neighbors by thickets of briar roses and stinging nettles, and a prehistoric bog where prehistory is rumoured to remain quite active.

Deep within the Fiorraga mountains, a great obsidian palace looms large and inpregnable between formidable stone monoliths and sparkling quartz cliffs, burbled angrily upon by violent arctic seafoam. The imperial palace, a hybrid of art-deco, Gigeresque, and neo-gothic architecture, seems at once to claw at the earth and to grasp at the stars, the latter impression underscored by its proximity to the currently active volcano, Auldeglace. Auldeglace regularly pumps out nebulas of vulcan haze that hang low in the sky and block out the sun for much of the day.

The selectively low-tech hub of national activity encircling this northerly nook is known abroad as the city of Yfeldes. Occupants of the city enjoy 5 hour workdays, robust libraries, public education in the occult arts and free mystic military training during the mandatory conscription years of their youth. Vegetarian falconry is a national pastime, practiced by hermits and aristocrats alike.

Pocket settlements, sparsely-populated by an ancient alpine race (Fiorraga Auldres), are peppered throughout the crystalline mountains. These native people, ascetic monks mostly, adapted to the turbulent climate over millennia, and communicate extensively by way of avian heraldry - which caught on widely throughout the kingdom at large and, in light of a nationwide Internet ban, is Hitherlan's preferred means of correspondence.

These hermits, the solemn ornithologists of Hitherlani culture, maintain a sacred bond between the winged emissaries of the Thereafter and this delicate mortal coil. Their practices are as timeless as the mountain corridors they inhabit.

It is said by some that Hitherlan was formed in a yestermillennia when the region's indigenous tribes were mythically conquered by a great evil that since vanished into obscurity. It is said by some that the legends of the mountain folk hold the forgotten secrets of the Old World. It is said by others that "they themselves forgot and made up a bunch of myths to patch in the gaps. Oh, oral history, you quaint doddering thing you."

To the south, between the capitol and border-region bog, the terrain slopes into barren storm-embattled steppe inhabited by rural farmers. Approximately central to the the lowlands, a large mirror-surfaced lake nourishes fauna in the steppe's vast circumference. The serfs there used to watch junk television and twiddle with smartphones before these things were banned. Now the Olds among them make fun for themselves with internecine gladitorial disputes while 25% of the smarter kids try to learn science via free public college.
The other 75% of smart kids went into illegal promotion of black market ticket sales to pleb-sponsored battle royale events. Anthropomorphic creatures maintain the accessibility of infrastructure and perform a lot of noble work in society since the government afforded them personhood and opposable thumbs.

Communication barriers still prove an issue.

<b>Noteworthy Figures</b>
Hitherlan's most prominent mythic heroes include the God-Empress Astryd, her Unseelie Court and First of the Reagent, Changeling Jione (pronounced "Johnny").

The nation's current leader, Lord Reagent Smar, is one of a long line of reagents ascended since the territory was conquered in the ol' B.C.E. days. The reagents fill the archetypal role once purportedly played by Changeling Jione, a faithful servant of the sun-blighting God-Empress Astryd. Changelings are ritually integrated into Hitherlan politics when the imperial Unseelie Court cyclically sends an immortal emissary in the form of an unseelie child to walk among mortals, replacing a Felemelte/human child with one of their own. This unique form of embassy results in exquisite intel into the surrounding southerly populations and a freshening up of the council's bloodline as the reagant takes an Unseelie mate in betrothal. The Hitherlan population, a mixture of humans and forest creatures recognized equally as sharing inalienable rights of citizenship, remain conventionally mortal and earthly and are left to intermarry amongst themselves.

In the modern era, this happens to represent a relatively small (human) gene pool, and thus the population of local humans are deemed unkindly but not altogether inaccurately to be a bit imbred. Hitherlan history, for what it's worth, holds it that this was not always the case. 

<b>Whispers & Rumours: Truth & Lies</b>
- One day when the sun is blighted by a terrible storm, God Empress Astrid will rise from the ashes to reclaim her throne.
- Fiorraga Auldres (ancient mountain people) are shapeshifters whose native form appears avian...crowlike and owlike. They can (and have, and do) intermarry with the humans...and anyone they please.
- Fiorraga Auldres are all asexual aesthetics
- Fiorraga Auldres sometimes sneak members of their ancient people into the cribs of commoners Greyveldt-wide, stealing the babies of 'mortals' to be raised.
- Some sources say the non-FA babies are eaten.
- Fiorraga Auldres are sometimes referred to as 'the Unseelie', and hence, the advisory council of Hitherlan is called the Unseelie Court.
- That these shapeshifters age is said to be a spiritual toll - a trade they made with the gods: arcane powers granted for mortality. But those among them who don't believe in gods have a more empirical explanation: the nature of Materiality (a spirit's existence in the mortal realm) is 

<b>Literally whispering now, don't tell anyone but this is legit</b>
- FA aren't really immortal, they just live an unusually long time. ~200-250 years, generally, with the oldest rumored to have lived to 310. But who knows if they kept dates well back in those days, maybe they just lost count or something. It's not like someone was collecting birthday candles for 3 centuries.
- FA are mostly hermetic, loners, reclusive except for their birds. They're endowed with an empathic/psionic link to birds, including Felemeltian birdfolk. The degree of that link varies by an individual's arcane aptitude, age, practice, etc.
- As FA age, their bodies weaken, but their passive arcana increases (prophetic visions, deepening empathic connections with living things to an almost telepathic extent, communing with the dead). This is because, as they age, the veil between worlds thins. A Fiorraga Auldre's age-related transition to the Nether is a more gradual, less jarring process than it is for most mortals. Days pass, the candle burns, and one day it burns out.
- FA often reference 'the burning of the candle'. It has yet to be seen whether this is a literal candle each of them guards against the world that marks the beginning and end of their lives, or if it's some astral plane object outside of mundane perception, or if it's just a metaphor upon which they all got the memo.
- One might wonder why a shapeshifter need age at all. As a Fiorraga Auldre once explained it, 
"We each are poured into this world: a cup filled to the brim. Each moment, Death takes a drink. We Fiorraga Auldre cups may change our liquid contents (apple juice to wine) but cannot replenish the quantity. To bear the pitcher of Time is another responsibility altogether."
- While age brings about a maturation of FA's passive arcana, it also crystalizes form. Shapeshifting becomes a more resistant process. There is some risk for an eldery FA to become trapped in a form they inhabit for very long.
